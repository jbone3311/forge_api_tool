# AI-Enhanced Testing Template

## Test Planning
- [ ] Use knowledge graph to understand component dependencies
- [ ] Check memory for previous testing patterns
- [ ] Create sequential thinking plan for test strategy

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test individual functions/methods
- [ ] Mock external dependencies
- [ ] Use knowledge graph to identify edge cases
- [ ] Document test decisions

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test component interactions
- [ ] Use knowledge graph to map integration points
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Validate data flow

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Test complete user workflows
- [ ] Use sequential thinking for test scenarios
- [ ] Document user stories
- [ ] Validate business requirements

## AI-Assisted Testing Commands
```bash
# Analyze test coverage
knowledge-graph: "Show untested components"

# Plan test scenarios
sequential-thinking: "Create test plan for [feature]"

# Document testing decisions
memory-bank: "Record testing strategy: [approach]"

# Generate test cases
sequential-thinking: "Generate test cases for [component]"
```

## Test Documentation
- [ ] Document test strategy and approach
