# AI Development Workflow Template

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Planning Phase
- [ ] Define feature requirements
- [ ] Check project memory for similar features
- [ ] Create sequential thinking plan
- [ ] Document architectural decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Implement step by step
- [ ] Use knowledge graph for dependency analysis
- [ ] Document code changes

### 3. Testing Phase
- [ ] Write tests for new functionality
- [ ] Run existing test suite
- [ ] Document test results

### 4. Documentation Phase
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### 5. Review Phase
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Update project memory
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Memory Commands

- `memory-bank: "Document lesson: [insight]"`

## Knowledge Graph Commands
- `knowledge-graph: "Show dependencies for [component]"`
- `knowledge-graph: "Find files using [functionality]"`

## Sequential Thinking Commands
