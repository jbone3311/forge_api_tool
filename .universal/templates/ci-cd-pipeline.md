# CI/CD Pipeline Template (Universal)

## ðŸš€ Overview

This template provides a complete CI/CD pipeline configuration that can be adapted for any project. It includes testing, security scanning, code quality checks, and deployment stages.

## ðŸ“‹ Pipeline Stages

### 1. **Build & Test Stage**
- Environment setup
- Dependency installation
- Code quality checks
- Unit and integration tests
- Test coverage reporting

### 2. **Security Stage**
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security linting
- Secrets detection

### 3. **Deployment Stage**
- Environment-specific deployments
- Health checks
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring setup

## ðŸš¨ Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
```yaml
# Add to deployment workflow
- name: Rollback on failure
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "Deployment failed, initiating rollback"
    # Add rollback commands here
```

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Manual rollback script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Initiating manual rollback..."

# Stop current deployment
echo "Stopping current deployment..."

# Restore previous version
echo "Restoring previous version..."

# Verify rollback
echo "Verifying rollback..."

# Notify team
echo "Rollback completed"
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency:** How often deployments occur
- **Lead Time:** Time from commit to deployment
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Time to recover from failures
- **Change Failure Rate:** Percentage of deployments causing failures

### Monitoring Setup
```yaml
# Add to deployment workflow
- name: Set up monitoring
  run: |
    echo "Setting up application monitoring"
    # Add monitoring setup commands here

- name: Configure alerts
  run: |
    echo "Configuring alerting rules"
    # Add alert configuration here
```

This CI/CD pipeline template provides a comprehensive foundation for automated testing, security scanning, and deployment that can be adapted for any project.
