# 🚀 Simple Forge API Tool

## Why This Version Exists

The original app was **way too complicated** with:
- 8 different services that all need to work together
- Complex error handling that created more problems
- External API dependencies that weren't available
- Multiple background processes competing for resources

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **Simplified Architecture**
- **Single Flask app** instead of 8 services
- **No external API dependencies** - works without Stable Diffusion running
- **Simple error handling** that doesn't cascade failures
- **Clean, readable code** that's easy to understand and modify

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- **Left-side popup** instead of center modal
- **Comprehensive logging** - all actions are logged and viewable
- **No loading spinners** that get stuck
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes

### 3. **Reliable Functionality**
- **Always works** - no complex dependencies
- **Fast startup** - no service initialization delays
- **Clear error messages** when something goes wrong
- **Easy debugging** with built-in log viewer

## 🎯 How to Use
