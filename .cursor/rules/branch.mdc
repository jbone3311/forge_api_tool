# Branch Management and Context Switching

## Core Principles
- Switch memory context when changing branches
- Maintain branch-specific progress tracking
- Preserve branch-specific knowledge graphs
- Update context automatically on branch changes

## Branch Context Switching
When switching branches, reload Memory Bank if --path includes ${GIT_BRANCH}.

## Branch-Specific Operations
- Load branch-specific memory context
- Switch to branch-specific knowledge graph
- Update sequential thinking context
- Maintain branch-specific documentation

## Context Preservation
- Preserve memory across branch switches
- Maintain separate progress tracking per branch
- Keep branch-specific design decisions
- Track branch evolution independently

## Integration with Git
- Detect branch changes automatically
- Update MCP tool contexts
- Maintain branch-specific caches
- Preserve branch history
