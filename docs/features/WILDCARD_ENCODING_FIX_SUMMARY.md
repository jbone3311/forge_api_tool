# Wildcard Encoding Fix - Feature Summary

## 🎯 Overview

The Wildcard Encoding Fix is a comprehensive solution for detecting and resolving encoding issues in wildcard files. This feature addresses the common problem of UTF-16 encoded files that cause read errors when the application tries to load wildcards.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ **Comprehensive File Scanning**
- **Recursive Discovery**: Automatically finds all `.txt` files in wildcard directories
- **Multiple Encoding Support**: Detects UTF-16, UTF-16-BE, and UTF-8 encodings
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### ✅ **Safe Operation**
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview changes without making them
- **Verification**: Confirms files are readable after conversion
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of file access issues
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive logging of all operations

### ✅ **Multiple Interfaces**
- **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface with full feature support
- **Web Dashboard**: Integrated into Settings modal with real-time feedback
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for programmatic access

## 📊 Current Status

### Files Analyzed: 186 wildcard files
### Issues Found: 3 files with UTF-16 encoding
- `wildcards\actions.txt`
- `wildcards\people.txt`
- `wildcards\Sort\art_styles\art_movements.txt`

### Status: Ready for production use

## 🛠️ Usage

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Check for encoding issues (safe preview)
python cli.py wildcards fix-encoding --dry-run
