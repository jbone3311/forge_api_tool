# Template Prompt Loading Fix

## Problem
The web dashboard was not automatically pulling in the built-in prompts from templates. Users had to manually type prompts even though the templates contained `base_prompt` fields with wildcards like `__SUBJECT__`, `__STYLE__`, etc.

## Root Cause
The web interface required users to manually enter prompts in the prompt input field, but it didn't automatically populate this field with the template's built-in base prompt when a template was selected.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Template Selection Functionality
**File: `web_dashboard/static/js/dashboard.js`**

- **Modified `selectTemplate()` function**: Now fetches the template's base prompt via API and populates the prompt input field
- **Added event listener for config select dropdown**: Automatically loads template prompts when users select from the dropdown
- **Added helpful notifications**: Shows informative messages when templates are loaded, indicating whether they contain wildcards
- **Auto-load first template**: Automatically loads the first available template's prompt when the page loads

### 2. Improved User Interface
**File: `web_dashboard/templates/dashboard.html`**

- **Added helpful hint**: Added text indicating that users can click on template cards to load their prompts
- **Enhanced visual feedback**: Made it clearer that template cards are clickable

**File: `web_dashboard/static/css/dashboard.css`**

- **Enhanced hover effects**: Added a blue top border that appears on hover to make template cards more obviously clickable
- **Improved visual hierarchy**: Better visual feedback for interactive elements

### 3. API Integration
The solution leverages the existing `/api/configs/<config_name>` endpoint to fetch template details and extract the base prompt.

## How It Works Now

1. **Page Load**: When the dashboard loads, it automatically selects the first available template and populates the prompt field with its base prompt
2. **Template Card Click**: Clicking on any template card loads that template's base prompt into the prompt field
3. **Dropdown Selection**: Selecting a template from the dropdown also loads its base prompt
4. **User Feedback**: Helpful notifications inform users about what happened and whether the template contains wildcards
5. **Wildcard Support**: Templates with wildcards (like `__SUBJECT__`) are displayed as-is, allowing users to edit them or generate with wildcards

## Example Workflow

1. User opens the dashboard
2. The first template (e.g., "SD Default") is automatically loaded
3. The prompt field shows: `"a stunning __SUBJECT__ in __STYLE__, __LIGHTING__, __COMPOSITION__, __MEDIUM__, __MOOD__, __WEATHER__, __SETTING__, high quality, detailed, masterpiece, professional photography, award winning"`
4. User can either:
   - Edit the wildcards manually (replace `__SUBJECT__` with "cat", etc.)
   - Generate as-is (wildcards will be automatically resolved)
   - Click another template card to load a different base prompt

## Benefits

- **Improved UX**: Users no longer need to manually type prompts
- **Template Utilization**: Templates' built-in prompts are now actually used
- **Wildcard Awareness**: Users can see and edit wildcards directly
- **Flexibility**: Users can still customize prompts or use them as-is
- **Visual Clarity**: Better indication of clickable elements and template loading

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_template_prompt_loading.py`) was created to verify:
- All templates have base prompts
- Wildcard files are available
- Template loading functionality works correctly

## Files Modified

1. `web_dashboard/static/js/dashboard.js` - Core functionality
2. `web_dashboard/templates/dashboard.html` - UI hints
3. `web_dashboard/static/css/dashboard.css` - Visual enhancements
4. `test_template_prompt_loading.py` - Test script (new)

## Result

The web dashboard now properly utilizes the built-in prompts from templates, making the template system much more user-friendly and functional. Users can see the template's intended prompt structure and either use it as-is or customize it to their needs.
