## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Starting a New Feature
```bash
# 1. Check project context
memory-bank: get_file_content project="main" path="progress.md"

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[description]

# 3. Plan implementation
sequential-thinking: "Create 5-step plan for [feature]"

# 4. Analyze dependencies
knowledge-graph: "Show all files affected by [component]"

# 5. Generate code
sequential-thinking: "Generate code for step 1: [description]"

# 6. Document decisions
memory-bank: "Record implementation decisions for [feature]"
```

### Scenario 2: Testing New Component
```bash
# 1. Analyze component structure
knowledge-graph: "Show all functions in [component]"

# 2. Generate test plan
sequential-thinking: "Create comprehensive test plan for [component]"

# 3. Generate test code
sequential-thinking: "Generate pytest test cases for [component]"

# 4. Run and analyze
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# 5. Document testing approach
memory-bank: "Record testing strategy for [component]"
```

### Scenario 3: Refactoring Code
```bash
# 1. Safety check
git checkout -b refactor/[component]
pytest  # Ensure baseline tests pass

# 2. Load refactor template
docs-provider: "Get ai-assisted-refactoring.md template"

# 3. Analyze impact
knowledge-graph: "Show all dependencies of [component]"

# 4. Execute safely
sequential-thinking: "Generate code for step 1: [description]"

# 5. Document changes
memory-bank: "Document refactor decisions and lessons learned"
```
